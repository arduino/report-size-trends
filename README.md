# `arduino/report-size-trends` action

This action records the memory usage of the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) sketch specified to the [`arduino/compile-examples` action](https://github.com/arduino/compile-sketches)'s [`size-report-sketch` input](https://github.com/arduino/compile-sketches#size-report-sketch) to a [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) spreadsheet.

## Inputs

### `sketches-report-path`

Path that contains the JSON formatted sketch data report, as specified to the `arduino/compile-examples` action's [sketches-report-path input](https://github.com/arduino/compile-sketches#sketches-report-path).

**Default**: `"size-deltas-reports"`

### `google-key-file`

**Required** Contents of the Google key file used to update the size trends report Google Sheets spreadsheet. This should be defined using a [GitHub encrypted secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets).
